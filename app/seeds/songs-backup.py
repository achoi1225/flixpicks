I wanna start this out and say<br />
I gotta get it off my chest (My chest)<br />
Got no anger, got no malice<br />
Just a little bit of regret (Regret)<br />
Know nobody else will tell you<br />
So there's some things I gotta say<br />
Gonna jot it down and then get it out<br />
And then I'll be on my way<br />
<br />
[Pre-Chorus]<br />
No, you're not half the man you think that you are<br />
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars<br />
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you<br />
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad<br />
I tried to help you, it just made you mad<br />
And I had no warning about who you are<br />
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down<br />
And then ran so fucking far<br />
That you would never ever touch me again<br />
Won't see your alligator tears<br />
'Cause know I've had enough of them<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
I'm gonna start this out by saying (By saying)<br />
I really meant well from the start<br />
Take a broken man right in my hands<br />
And then put back all his parts<br />
<br />
[Pre-Chorus]<br />
But you're not half the man you think that you are<br />
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars<br />
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you<br />
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)<br />
I feel so sad (I feel so sad)<br />
I tried to help you (I tried to help you)<br />
It just made you mad<br />
And I had no warning (I had no warning)<br />
About who you are (About who you are)<br />
Just glad I made it out without breaking down<br />
Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)<br />
I feel so sad (I feel so sad)<br />
I tried to help you (I tried to help you)<br />
It just made you mad<br />
And I had no warning (I had no warning)<br />
About who you are (About who you are)<br />
'Bout who you are<br />
<br />
[Bridge]<br />
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah<br />
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah<br />
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah<br />
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah<br />
<br />
[Pre-Chorus]<br />
'Cause you're not half the man you think that you are<br />
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars<br />
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you<br />
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you<br />
<br />
[Outro]<br />
I feel so sad<br />
You should be sad<br />
You should be<br />
You should be sad<br />
You should be<br />
You should be<br />
You should be[Intro]<br />
Yeah<br />
<br />
[Verse 1]<br />
I've been tryna call<br />
I've been on my own for long enough<br />
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe<br />
I'm going through withdrawals<br />
You don't even have to do too much<br />
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby<br />
<br />
[Pre-Chorus]<br />
I look around and<br />
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)<br />
No one's around to judge me (Oh)<br />
I can't see clearly when you're gone<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br />
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br />
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br />
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br />
Hey, hey, hey<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
I'm running out of time<br />
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky<br />
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh<br />
<br />
[Pre-Chorus]<br />
The city's cold and empty (Oh)<br />
No one's around to judge me (Oh)<br />
I can't see clearly when you're gone<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br />
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br />
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br />
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br />
<br />
[Bridge]<br />
I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)<br />
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)<br />
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br />
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br />
Hey, hey, hey<br />
Hey, hey, hey<br />
<br />
[Outro]<br />
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br />
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch[Verse 1]<br />
